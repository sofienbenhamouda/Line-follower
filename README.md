### **Software**
Language: C++
Environment: Arduino IDE
Algorithm: PID control for precise line tracking
Libraries: QTR Sensors library

### **Mechanical Design on SolidWorks**

The robot's mechanical structure was designed using SolidWorks, leveraging my CSWA certification skills to create a lightweight and efficient chassis. Key design aspects include:

Chassis Design: A compact, rectangular chassis (150mm x 100mm x 50mm) was modeled to house the Arduino Mega, L298 motor driver, and LiPo battery while minimizing weight. The chassis was 3D-printed using PLA for rapid prototyping.

Motor Mounting: The two N20 motors were securely mounted at the rear using custom brackets designed in SolidWorks, ensuring proper alignment for differential drive.

Sensor Placement: The QTR-8 sensor arrays were positioned at the front, 10mm above the ground, with a custom mounting plate to maintain consistent sensor-to-track distance across uneven surfaces.

Below is a screenshot of the 3D model in SolidWorks:

### **Features**
- Accurate line tracking with a PID algorithm for smooth navigation.
- Dynamic speed adjustment of N20 motors based on sensor feedback.
- Calibration of QTR-8 sensors for varying track conditions.


### **Evolution and Achievements**
This robot has undergone several upgrades over the past three years, improving its speed, stability, and sensor accuracy. Key milestones include:

- 2022: Initial build with basic line-following capabilities.
- 2023: Optimized PID tuning and upgraded to a 16V LiPo battery for better performance.
- 2024: Enhanced sensor calibration and motor control for sharper turns using the dual max14870.

The robot has competed in various national robotics competitions, achieving:
First Place: 3 times 
Second Place: 2 times
